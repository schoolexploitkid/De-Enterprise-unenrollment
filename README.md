# De-Enterprise-unenrollment
Unenroll chromebooks by taking out a card from the chromebook and replacing it with a new one.

You must be willing to take apart your chromebook in order to do this.

Eh, I might add a video later if...

## Steps:
This COULD harm your chromebook if done incorrectly, but I am not responsible for that.
Follow these exact steps.
1. Open your chromebook
2. Check the brand and type of the drive (circled in red in the image)
3. Find and buy it online (make sure it is the exact same one!!!)
4. Take the old one out and put the new one in
5. Turn on your chromebook
6. It should be unenrolled, if its not, then go cry
7. To re-enroll, put the old chip on and keep the old one
