    <h1>De-Enterprise Unenrollment</h1>
    <p>Unenroll Chromebooks by taking out a card from the Chromebook and replacing it with a new one.</p>
    <p>You must be willing to take apart your Chromebook in order to do this.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>This COULD harm your Chromebook if done incorrectly, but I am not responsible for that. Follow these exact steps.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open your Chromebook</li>
        <li>Check the brand and type of the drive (circled in red in the image)</li>
        <li>Find and buy it online (make sure it is the exact same one!!!)</li>
        <li>Take the old one out and put the new one in</li>
        <li>Turn on your Chromebook</li>
        <li>It should be unenrolled, if it's not, then go cry</li>
        <li>To re-enroll, put the old chip on and keep the old one</li>
    </ol>
